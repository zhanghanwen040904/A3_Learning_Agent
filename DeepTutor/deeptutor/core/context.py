    Everything a capability or tool needs to process a single user turn.

    Attributes:
        session_id: Persistent conversation identifier.
        user_message: The current user input.
        conversation_history: Previous messages in OpenAI format.
        enabled_tools: Tool names the user has toggled on (Level 1).
            ``None`` means "not specified", while ``[]`` means
            "explicitly disable all optional tools".
        active_capability: Capability name selected by the user, or None for plain chat.
        knowledge_bases: KB names to use for RAG.
        attachments: Images / files sent with the message.
        config_overrides: Per-request config tweaks (e.g. temperature).
        language: UI / response language ("en" | "zh").
        memory_context: Memory snapshot text injected into the system prompt.
        persona_context: Selected persona's instructions, eagerly injected
            into the system prompt (a persona must shape the voice from the
            first token; empty when no persona is active).
        skills_manifest: System-prompt Skills block — one line per
            capability skill visible to this user, plus any ``always``
            skills' full bodies. The model pulls full skill content on
            demand via the ``read_skill`` tool.
        source_manifest: Plain-text manifest of attached sources (one line per
            source: id/name/type/preview). Empty when no sources are attached.
            Consumed by the chat capability to render an "Attached Sources"
            section in the system prompt and to enable the ``read_source`` tool.
        metadata: Catch-all for capability-specific extras.
